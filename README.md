# AST Syntax Highlighting with Optics

Would it be possible, and feasible, to express syntax highlighting rules via _optics_?

## Current Achievment

Given an Abstract Syntax Tree stub of this form:

```swift
let ast = Root(block: .blockquote(.table(.code("Hello"))))
```

We can express getting to the inline `.code` inside a `.table` inside a `.blockquote` from the document root like so:

```swift
let deepReach = Root.blockLens
  >>> /BlockToken.blockquote
  >>> /BlockToken.table
  >>> /InlineToken.code

let value = deepReach.tryGet(ast) // â†’ "Hello"
```
